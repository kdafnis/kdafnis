- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Previously involved in (Human) Action Recognition, Video Understanding and Reasoning projects.
- 🌱 My current area of research revolves around self-supervised and unsupervised representation learning for domain adaptation. More specifically, I am            interested on making pre-trained neural networks robust to out-of-distribution data on-the-fly at test-time. 
- 💞️ I am open for collaboration on Computer Vision projects.
