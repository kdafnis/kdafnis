<h2> Hi there, I am Konstantinos M. Dafnis! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"> </h2>
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Previously involved in (Human) Action Recognition, Video Understanding and Reasoning projects.
- 🌱 My current area of research revolves around self-supervised and unsupervised representation learning for domain adaptation. More specifically, I am            interested on making pre-trained neural networks robust to out-of-distribution data on-the-fly at test-time. 
- 💞️ I am open for collaboration on Computer Vision projects.
